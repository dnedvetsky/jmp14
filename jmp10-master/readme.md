1. Created databases with users (users are absolutely random)
2. SQLite is slow database, many inputs performed quite slowly so db file attached with a lot of users
3. SQLite result set does not support anything except FORWARD ONLY
4. Timestamps used as date (some timestamps were accidently added as Epoch)
